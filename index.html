      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>The Oak & the Reeds A Giant Oak stood near a brook in which grew some slender Reeds. When the wind blew, the great Oak stood proudly upright with its hundred arms uplifted to the sky. But the Reeds bowed low in the wind and sang a sad and mournful
        song.</p>
      <p>"Do not worry about us," replied the Reeds. "The winds do not harm us. We bow before them and so we do not break. You, in all your pride and strength, have so far resisted their blows. But the end is coming." Better to yield when it is folly to
        resist, than to resist stubbornly and be destroyed.</p>
